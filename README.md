# challenge-reports
When someone reports a challenge from within the MapRoulette UI, an issue is created here.

Note that all issues are created by user `mvexel`. This is because `mvexel` issued the token that allows MapRoulette to communicate with the GitHub API. We'll look into fixing that sometime. For now, please see the issue details to see the actual reporter.

## Issue template

The template for a created issue is:

### Title

Reported Challenge #[CHALLENGE_ID] - [CHALLENGE TITLE]

### Description

Challenge: [[CHALLENGE_ID] - [CHALLENGE TITLE]]() *# Link goes to Challenge browse page*

Reported by: [OSM_USERNAME]() *# Link goes to osm.org/user/OSM_USERNAME*

[The text that was entered by the user in the Report UI]
